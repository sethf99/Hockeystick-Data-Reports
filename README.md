# Hockeystick-Data-Reports

I once worked for a startup, Hockeystick Co., which gathered data on startup investments to assess the health of the startup business ecosystem. To this end, we published quarterly reports describing the activity in different regional ecosystems. I worked on the Q4 2020 and Q1 2021 Waterloo ecosystem reports, wherein I did the majority of the data analysis to create the insights, designed many of the visuals to present the insights, and drafted most of the copy accompanying them. The Q4 2020 and Q1 2021 Waterloo startup ecosystem reports are available at the following links:
